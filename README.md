# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   - Within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. You want to incrementally run tests so that, if a failure did occur, you could fix it quickly and easily. This is analogous to pushing a big rock up the hill incrementally as shown in lecture.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
    - No, E2E testing is used to replicate the workflow from start to finish
